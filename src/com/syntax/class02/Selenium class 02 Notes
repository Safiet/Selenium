What is Webelement?
Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a web element
e.g. buttons, textbones,checkboxes,deopdowns etc



What is HTML?
HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language;

What is DOM?
DOM - Document Object Module; it is a browsers internal view of the webpage
Also called Developer Tools

Document -- can be stored any document, like pdf excel or word

Object -- any line in HTMLis called an Object

Model -- it is just a layout of the HTML file in DOM;

What is Locator?
Locator -- is an address or a position of a webelement in the web page
it is used to locate or identify the webelement on the webpage

8 Locators:
ID
Name
ClassName
TagName
CSS
Xpath
LinkText
PartialLinkText

HTML Scripting Meaning:
purple --- will be a tags
orange or brown --- will be atributes
blue --- will be value
green --- will be comments
red --- for developers not for testers

Why do we need so many locators?
-- some locators might have duplicate values
-- Developers might not provide all the locators for the same element
-- Some locators may not be applicable to all the elements
  e.g. linktext partialLinkTest are only used for Links

"a" tag in HTML is called anchor tag

If 2 or more elements have same atributes and attribute values Selenium will only see the first one and
 will only interact with the  first element
